                        <h3>Why do my best cards always get discarded? / Why do I/my opponent draw 6 brobnar cards every turn?</h3>
                        <p>This is question that gets asked a lot (usually less politely!).  The shuffle code is fine.  It uses a Fisher-Yates algorithm which is the best card shuffling algorithm available.  Real randomness can be quite jarring when you&apos;re used to imperfect human shuffling.  But why believe me? Believe the numbers:</p>
                        <p>The discard random card code has been run through a test routine 1 million times, here are the results for a hand size of 6:</p>
