## Doesn't this look a lot like Jinteki/Throneteki? The Android netrunner/AGOT online experience?

Glad you noticed! Yes, jinteki was a huge inspiration for this project, as the interface is clean and user friendly, so I've tried to make this similar in a lot of ways

Keyteki is a fork of the [ringteki sourcecode](https://github.com/ringteki/ringteki).
