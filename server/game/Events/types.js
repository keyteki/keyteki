/**
 * Definition of all the event names in KeyForge that can be raised or listened
 * to.
 *
 * The “params” noted below have been `extend`ed on to the given `Event`
 * objects. All events typically have a `context` param, so we do not mention it
 * below.
 *
 * Events are typically created by the different {@link GameAction} subclasses.
 * They serve both as a notification that something is happening and the
 * implementation of that something (by virtue of being given a `handler`
 * function by the Action).
 *
 * When writing a listener for an event, pay attention to the specific triggers
 * and Actions mentioned below. Some events have generic-sounding names, like
 * `onRemoveToken`, but that doesn’t mean that they necessarily trigger every
 * time a counter is removed from a card. For example, no `onRemoveToken` event
 * fires if you use a creature to pop a stun.
 *
 * During the `interrupt` listening phase, other effects can be notified of the
 * Event’s impending resolution. They can use a {@link ChangeEventAction} to
 * update the event’s params and therefore alter its behavior, or cancel it
 * entirely to prevent resolution.
 *
 * The `reaction` phase happens after the `handler` has executed, and notably
 * will _not_ happen if the event was cancelled (_e.g._ a creature in a fight
 * sustained lethal damage from assault before the rest of the fight could
 * resolve).
 *
 * This means that below we describe events both as triggering when something is
 * _about_ to happen as well as sometimes the mechanical implementation of that
 * “something.” Note however that the execution is determined by the **action**
 * and is not an inherent property of the event type. Some events are created in
 * multiple places (`onUseCard` is a good example) and their creators are free
 * to give them different handlers, though this is generally rare.
